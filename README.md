Real-Time Data Processing System for Weather Monitoring with Rollups and Aggregates

Objective:
Develop a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide
summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. The system will utilize data from the
OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/).
Data Source:
The system will continuously retrieve weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. You will
need to sign up for a free API key to access the data. The API provides various weather
parameters, and for this assignment, we will focus on:

● main: Main weather condition (e.g., Rain, Snow, Clear)
● temp: Current temperature in Centigrade
● feels_like: Perceived temperature in Centigrade
● dt: Time of the data update (Unix timestamp)
Processing and Analysis:
● The system should continuously call the OpenWeatherMap API at a configurable interval
(e.g., every 5 minutes) to retrieve real-time weather data for the metros in India. (Delhi,
Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata, Hyderabad)
● For each received weather update:
○ Convert temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (tip : you can also use user
preference).
Rollups and Aggregates:
1. Daily Weather Summary:
○ Roll up the weather data for each day.
○ Calculate daily aggregates for:
■ Average temperature
■ Maximum temperature
■ Minimum temperature
■ Dominant weather condition (give reason on this)
○ Store the daily summaries in a database or persistent storage for further analysis.
2. Alerting Thresholds:
○ Define user-configurable thresholds for temperature or specific weather
conditions (e.g., alert if temperature exceeds 35 degrees Celsius for two
consecutive updates).
○ Continuously track the latest weather data and compare it with the thresholds.
○ If a threshold is breached, trigger an alert for the current weather conditions.
Alerts could be displayed on the console or sent through an email notification
system (implementation details left open-ended).

3. Implement visualizations:
○ To display daily weather summaries, historical trends, and triggered alerts.

Test Cases:
1. System Setup:
○ Verify system starts successfully and connects to the OpenWeatherMap API
using a valid API key.

2. Data Retrieval:
○ Simulate API calls at configurable intervals.
○ Ensure the system retrieves weather data for the specified location and parses
the response correctly.
3. Temperature Conversion:

○ Test conversion of temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius (or Fahrenheit)
based on user preference.
4. Daily Weather Summary:
○ Simulate a sequence of weather updates for several days.
○ Verify that daily summaries are calculated correctly, including average, maximum,
minimum temperatures,and dominant weather condition.

5. Alerting Thresholds:
○ Define and configure user thresholds for temperature or weather conditions.
○ Simulate weather data exceeding or breaching the thresholds.
○ Verify that alerts are triggered only when a threshold is violated.

Bonus:
● Extend the system to support additional weather parameters from the OpenWeatherMap
API (e.g., humidity, wind speed) and incorporate them into rollups/aggregates.
● Explore functionalities like weather forecasts retrieval and generating summaries based
on predicted conditions.
Evaluation:
The assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
● Functionality and correctness of the real-time data processing system.
● Accuracy of data parsing, temperature conversion, and rollup/aggregate calculations.
● Efficiency of data retrieval and processing within acceptable intervals.
● Completeness of test cases covering various weather scenarios and user configurations.
● Clarity and maintainability of the codebase.
● (Bonus) Implementation of additional features.

Artifacts To be Submitted For the Assignments
● Codebase - preferably a github handle
● Readme should be comprehensive - build instructions and design choices are
mandatory
● Readme should contain dependencies to download for setting up and running the
application. E.g a webserver, Database all can be docker or podman containers
